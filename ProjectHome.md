# Wiki Export Eclipse plugin #

This project aims to solve a very common problem - **lack of documentation**.
If you think that this simple plugin is going to create the documentation for you, think again. Basically this is a tool to export the object documentation to Wiki format. By examining this format you will be able to see what documentation is missing.

I have uncounted this problem while working with the [JSystem test automation framework](http://www.jsystemtest.org). The framework allows creating a lot of system object that can be used by other developers. These objects should be well documented in order to make the test creation process fast.

## The required result is just three steps away... ##

### 1. Choose the correct export option ###
